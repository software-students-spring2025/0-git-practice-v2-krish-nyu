[AI-powered coding pulls in almost $1bn of funding to claim ‘killer app’ status] (https://www.ft.com/content/4868bd38-613c-4fa9-ba9d-1ed8fa8a40c8)

**Why I find it interesting**:  
I found the article interesting as it gives color to the scale at which companies are trying to reduce costs of software building by investing in a AI-powered "killer" app. Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of GitHub, claimed that with GitHub Copilot writes better code than the average developer. It is clear this is a top priority for the business, as Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, stated in an earnings call that “Copilot accounted for over 40 per cent of GitHub revenue growth this year and is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when we acquired it".

**Comment (Maya Humston)**:

I also found this interesting! Although I'm curious what the basis of the CEO's claims are and whether Copilot truly can write better code (and what constitutes "better" code anyway.) It seems most companies are investing in this early, perhaps without regard to the outcome or long-term effects, blinded only by short-term revenue.
